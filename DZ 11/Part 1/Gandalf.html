         Gandalf is a protagonist in J. R. R. Tolkien <em>"The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings"</em>.<br>
        He is a wizard, one of the Istari order, and the leader of the Fellowship of the Ring.<br>
        Tolkien took the name "Gandalf" from the Old Norse <em>"Catalogue of Dwarves"</em> (Dvergatal) in the Völuspá.<br>

         As a wizard and the bearer of one of the Three Rings, Gandalf has great power, <br>
        but works mostly by encouraging and persuading. He sets out as Gandalf the Grey, <br>
        possessing great knowledge and travelling continually. Gandalf is focused on the mission <br>
        to counter the Dark Lord Sauron by destroying the One Ring. He is associated with fire; <br>
        his ring of power is Narya, the Ring of Fire. As such, he delights in fireworks to entertain<br>
        the hobbits the Shire, while in great need he uses fire as a weapon. As one of the Maiar, <br>
        he is an immortal spirit from Valinor, but his physical body can be killed.
